= JavaFX Business Control for City and Postcode Selection

Cities and postcodes have a `1 to n` relation.
In order to help display and select these to values, I developed a custom JavaFX business control.

Furthermore, this project showcases the powerful "skin", "control" and "binding" concepts of JavaFX.
